# Week-3-Homework
Giving the layout for the html and style pages for this homework, I am to create a working that will allow the user to to be able to generate a random code between the 8 and 128 characters while including special characters, upper and lower case letters, and numbers. Upon access to the page you will prompted with few questions as to how you would like for your randomized password to look. Once having gone through all propmts user will then be prompted to press the 'Generate Password' button to see their new randomized password. Copy a working generator code to generate password from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1497481/javascript-password-generator. (12/17/2020)Rewrote "password generating' code so that it is no longer a code copied, but one that I developed, while still having some aspects after an explanation and guidance from tutor; as well as looking over activity 3.23(RPS).
